# TypeScript and React

## Description

This is a super simple React app. It only has two buttons that increase or decrease a counter.

Your goal is to fix all the typing problems you find in the files. Hint: there are three main files: `src/components/Button/Button.tsx`, `src/hooks/useCounter/index.tsx`, and `src/pages/App/App.tsx`. 

Once you have fixed all the problems, run `yarn typecheck` to verify you are done.
